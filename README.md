Password Generator
 
For this project, I aim to improve the stength of the password generated by for a client that has access sensitive data.  My main motivation for this project is to find a way to generate passwords that meet several criterias and a length between 8 and 128 characters. To ensure the safety of the client's data, I have created a password generator that randomly assembles characters to build a very strong password. Being able to accomplish this passowrd generator will increase the safety of the client's data.
